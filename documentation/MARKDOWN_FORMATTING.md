# Markdown Formatting Enhancement

## What Changed

The RAG system now outputs **beautifully formatted markdown responses** with:

### ✨ Key Features

1. **Bold text** for important terms and concepts
2. *Italic text* for emphasis
3. `Code blocks` for technical terms
4. Organized bullet points and numbered lists
5. Headers for section organization
6. Blockquotes for special notes

### 📝 Example Output

When you ask a question, the AI will respond like this:

**Question:** "Explain machine learning"

**Response:**
```
## Machine Learning

**Machine learning** is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience. Here are the key concepts:

- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

### Applications

Machine learning powers many modern technologies:
1. Image recognition
2. Natural language processing
3. Recommendation systems

> **Note:** The response preserves markdown formatting for better readability while stripping it for voice output.
```

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements

- **Key points** are highlighted in bold
- Code terms appear in `orange monospace font`

### 🔊 Voice Compatibility

### 💡 Usage

Just ask your questions normally - the AI will automatically format responses with:
- Bold for **important concepts**

No special commands needed!
